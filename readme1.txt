It has been observed that most frequent vertex explosions in Bloodborne, when played using the shadPS4 emulator, occur on player and NPC faces. This mod removes the files associated with the Facegen middleware, which the game uses for face customization, as it appears to be the primary cause of the data corruption leading to these explosions.

Without Facegen, face shape customization will no longer function, meaning player characters will always have the default face shape for their body type. However, customization options for hair, hair color, eyes, and eye color remain unaffected. NPC faces appear to be largely unchanged by this mod.

 In my own experience, after 1.5 hours of gameplay, I have yet to encounter a vertex explosion. However, rare occurrences may still happen, as not all explosions are linked to Facegen. Currently, there is no known fix for these other instances, as their root cause remains unclear.
